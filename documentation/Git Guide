# Agile Dev

* Sprints (miletsones): Issues nest under milestones. They're specific deliverables over a timeline. Issues should be specific and 'closable'

* Epics: 

* Story points

* Tags:

## Pipelines (ZenHub feature)

New -> backlog -> In progress -> Review / QA -> Done for now -> Closed

Backlog is next to move into In Progress

Note: Link issues with your pull requests when you're making PRs. Only for granular to do or data set levels. 

Move things to done for now or Review QA/QC if you don't want to close something prematurely.


## Making or Editing Github Issues 

* Story points:
  - 1 clear path to completion with no unknowns complete in about an hour
  - 5 units of complexity: Eg. easy data set transformation
  - 8 units: medium data set transformation
  - 13 units: hard data set transformation
  - 21 units: bordlerine too complex.
  - 40 means way to complex
  
Difficulty defined by source languagge (russian?) metadata completeness, tidyness, number of people you have to talk to to work through things.

# Executive Summary

This Data Mobilization and Communication plan describes the evolving workflow applied by biological data scientists to format data from the series of ‘International Year of the Salmon’ associated fisheries and oceanography research cruises to international standards. The proposed approach can be applied to various scientific disciplines within the IYS project, and the data standardization, mobilization and integration are highlighted. Additionally, various critical components in the core IYS Data Mobilization digital infrastructure are described that support the standardization process. To adhere to open and FAIR data principles, data are standardized to an international standard using controlled vocabulary, ensuring longevity of the data and interoperability with the multitude of data that fall under the GOOS umbrella. A federated approach is used to integrate existing standards where community practice adopts them. Adopting international standards, such as DwC-A, and applying them to Essential Ocean Variables identified by GOOS, will ensure a multilateral approach to the standardization of salmon ocean ecology data collected. A proposed communication scheme is presented on how to effectively communicate this data mobilization and standardization approach throughout the IYS project, and improve and ensure understanding, collaboration and engagement with the research scientists involved.

# 1. Introduction 

The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) is implementing a five-year International Year of the Salmon (IYS) collaborative project through 2022 to set the conditions for the resilience of salmon and people in a rapidly changing world. This Data Mobilization and Communication plan aims to describe the current approach taken to standardize, mobilize and integrate data collected during the IYS research cruises, and includes ideas on how to streamline this process moving forward and bridge gaps between the scientific domains of salmon ocean ecology, and increase collaboration and engagement efforts with scientists. 

Improving understanding of how salmon ocean ecology data are standardized, mobilized and how the data are integrated in the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) framework should strengthen the foundation for scientists to collaborate and engage to deepen the impact of their work. The approach described in this report can be applied to various scientific disciplines within salmon ecology, but is especially useful for biological, geological, chemical, and physical data that relate to Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) as identified under each of the three domains in the GOOS framework (see section 4.1). The majority of the data collected during the 2019 research expedition is centralized in the International Year of the Salmon Ocean Observation System (IYS-OOS) repository. Through active collaboration and engagement with scientists throughout the data mobilization process, we strive to improve the quality of the (meta) deepen the impact of research through transdisciplinary data integration. 

This document is created for internal use between Hakai Institute, the IYS Secretariat, the NPAFC Study Group on High Seas Data Standardization and Mobilization (‘Study Group’), and the IYS Planning Team, consisting of the National Lead Scientists, Evgeny Pakhomov, Dick Beamish and Brian Riddell. Once finalized, it can be distributed to Principal Investigators (PIs) and IYS Expedition Scientists (see section 3) to improve understanding of the data mobilization process and the communication workflow. The document outlines the rationale behind choosing specific platforms, digital repositories and frameworks, and their associated data principles, and how the standardization process will help integrate salmon ocean ecology in a larger framework. 

## 1.1 FAIR Data Principles

Successful science depends on how standardized, integrated and accessible data are. Therefore, it is important that the data are open source and follow the FAIR data principles: the data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (Tanhua et al. 2019). 

* **F**indable: Data and supplemental materials need to have sufficiently rich metadata and a unique and persistent identifier. 
* **A**ccessible: Metadata and data are understandable to humans and machines. Data are deposited in a trusted, secure repository. 
* **I**nteroperable: Metadata use a formal, accessible, shared and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
* **R**eusable: Data and collections have clear usage licenses and provide accurate information on provenance. 

Open source data are data that can be freely used, shared, and built-on by anyone, anywhere and for any purpose. Having open data allows for version control and collaboration between scientists, improving data collection procedures, data recording, statistical analyses and the quality of the data output. By integrating/formatting - often referred to as 'tidying' or 'wrangling' - the IYS salmon ocean ecology data to an international standard, the interoperability is improved as it becomes easier to search and filter for the correct data in various data repositories. Interoperability allows building upon prior work, accelerating results and improving access to specialized knowledge, ultimately improving the credibility, longevity and repeatability of the data collected. 

## 1.2. TRUST Principles for Digital Repositories

The FAIR data principles highlight the need to embrace good practice by defining essential characteristics of data objects to ensure data longevity and reusability. To make the data comply with the FAIR data principles whilst ensuring their longevity requires trustworthy digital repositories (TDRs). To demonstrate the trustworthiness, a set of guiding principles has been created. Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability and Technology: the TRUST principles, provide a common framework to facilitate discussion and implementation of best practices in digital preservation (Lin et al., 2020). The TDRs selected throughout the data mobilization process have been selected based on their ability to meet the TRUST principles, which in turn makes the data more findable and accessible.

## 1.3. Objectives

The salmon ocean ecology data collected during the IYS research expeditions contain, among other things, both physical and biological data. Throughout the standardization workflow, the goal is to ensure that the data adhere to the FAIR data principles and are therefore interoperable within and between platforms, allowing for trans-disciplinary data integration within salmon ocean ecology data. 

The objectives of this Data Mobilization and Communication plan are three-fold: 

1. Describe the proposed data infrastructure scaffolding, and how it complies with the FAIR data principles and the TRUST principles for digital repositories (section 2.1); 
2. Provide a brief overview of current data standardization, mobilization and integration processes (section 2.2);
3. Describe the next steps in deepening the impact of IYS salmon ocean ecology research through a proposed communication plan (section 3).

Additionally, recommendations are provided on how to improve the data mobilization and communication approach taken (section 4). 

# 2. Methods

This document is supplemental to the International Year of the Salmon Data Mobilization Strategic Recommendations report and addresses in more detail the operational component of the standardization workflow. A brief overview of the proposed data cyberinfrastructure is given in section 2.1 to provide a framework for the standardization workflow approach.

## 2.1 Cyberinfrastructure 

The Data Mobilization and Communication plan is founded on the protocols and standards for archiving and providing open access to data in the framework as established by the GOOS. Some of the core objectives of the GOOS are, among others, to set the global standards and best practices for ocean-related data collection, curation (standardization), and mobilization. Expert agencies are partnered with the GOOS in biological data, including the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) and the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON). These organizations promote and develop the use of standardized terminology (“controlled vocabularies”). Adopting international standards encourages interoperability and reusability of data. Another benefit of this approach is the reproducibility of analyses, especially where repetitions of ‘naturally observed experiments’ are not possible. The GOOS focuses on distinct Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) within three domains: Physical & Climate, Biogeochemistry, and Biology & Ecosystems. The EOVs, identified by the GOOS Expert Panels, are data elements that are determined to have a high impact and feasibility, and assessments of these ensure that the best, most cost-effective plan is adopted across platforms to obtain data. Furthermore, in July 2019 GOOS, partnering with the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) adopted the ‘Ocean Best Practices System’ (OBPS) as a project under the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Controlled vocabulary is applied to the methods, units, values, and sampling protocols that are defined under the EOVs used in salmon ocean ecology and which also adhere to the ‘Ocean Best Practices’. 

Our current practice is that we publish completed data sets provided by scientists in a trustworthy digital repository that adheres to the TRUST principles, and extract core data elements (EOVs) to further standardize data to a format that is supported by the 'language' used by OBIS and GOOS. Biological (taxonomic or species occurrence) datasets and their metadata are published to OBIS using the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT), and physical / biogeochemical datasets are published to ERDDAP. The Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS), which follows the same syntax as GOOS, extracts the data from these repositories, and as the data have been standardized to a language that is supported by GOOS, the salmon ocean ecology data can feed into GOOS and is interoperable with the multitude of datasets under the GOOS umbrella. In other words, it makes the data easily and, more importantly, scientifically comparable with other data that have adopted these international standards.

## 2.2. Data Standardization Workflow

By reformatting the (meta)data to an international standard and having datasets follow a similar structure simplifies the process of searching for the data in the future. To ensure that people search for the correct terms, OBIS, like GOOS, promotes the use of a standardized set of terms in both the metadata and to label the data. This also enables records to be interpreted by computers, and opens up data sets to a whole world of possibilities for computer aided manipulation, distribution and long-term reuse. This approach must take into account ethical, legal, and scientific merits of sharing knowledge often complicated by differences in cultural systems of knowing. As the IYS is an international collaboration between Russia, Japan, South Korea, Canada and the US, it is imperative that the roles and responsibilities, data management practices and the licensing are clearly outlined. Conforming or adhering to an internationally agreed standard for data recording and data storage can significantly increase the range of data usage. 

The IYS salmon ocean ecology data we receive pertaining to a specific scientific discipline are currently stored in Google Drive, in a secure folder that is only accessible for people involved. Established communications with scientists ensure that the data that are being formatted are the final version. If changes were made to the data prior to transforming data to international standards, these changes were recorded in a changelog. Preference is given to not make any changes to the raw data directly, and instead code any changes so the data input remains intact. Raw data in this context is synonymous to data that has not been formatted to international standards.

The statistical computing language R and various package libraries are used to quality check, and curate data, with the initial goal of hosting the standardized data on ERDDAP or OBIS. As data are federated across the different data repositories, data have to be formatted to the international standard at the core prior to hosting. OBIS is typically used to host biological and occurrence data (e.g. trawl records), whereas ERDDAP is a platform used for physical or biogeochemical data (i.e. CTD data and bottle files) (Figure 1). In cases where collected variables are not synonymous with GOOS compatible terms, we need to determine whether there is a recognized and compatible repository where the data belong and can be federated or linked to the IYS-OOS. Standardized species occurrence and biogeochemical data can be federated across different data repositories, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), CIOOS National and the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR). Common data access protocols allow for meta searches among select data repositories. The R scripts of data transformation code are stored in a publicly accessible repository on GitHub.

Discipline-specific metadata associated with the IYS data is stored in a CKAN IYS-OOS Metadata catalogue, which includes links to the unprocessed data stored in Google Drive. Standardized biological (occurrence) data will be hosted on OBIS, whereas physical and biogeochemical data will be hosted on ERDDAP, from where it federates to CIOOS-Pacific and CIOOS National. These data repositories follow the syntax, or are partnered with, the GOOS framework.}
\end{figure}

The Darwin Core (DwC)^[https://obis.org/manual/darwincore/] is the body of standards for biodiversity in OBIS. DwC provides terms and vocabularies used to format data to an international standard. This 'archive' of terms and vocabularies (thus often referred to as Darwin Core Archive or DwC-A) is maintained by TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards, formerly The International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases). Aside from hosting biodiversity data, OBIS can also host environmental data (OBIS ENV-DATA). Using this approach, and standardizing both biological as well as environmental data according to DwC-A so that it can be hosted on OBIS, allows for biological and environmental data to be linked (see e.g. De Pooter et al. 2017). By standardizing and formatting the data according to DwC-A standards we ensure that the data are interoperable and reusable. This approach can be applied to near real-time data collected, future data and also historic data. 

In the process of salmon ocean ecology data standardization, controlled vocabulary is applied to the data. The OBIS’ recommended controlled vocabulary comes mostly from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Vocabulary Server^[http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/]. NERC provides access to lists of standardized terms that cover a broad spectrum of disciplines of relevance to the oceanographic and wider community. It gives scientists the means to access lists of controlled terms to describe data, saving time trying to unravel data sets. Furthermore, as OBIS is mainly centered around ocean biodiversity data, any species occurrences in the data are provided with a URN from the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) if applicable. 
Perhaps more important than the data itself is the associated metadata. Sufficiently rich metadata is required to make the data findable, accessible and improve responsibility. Well in advance of the 2022 Pan-Pacific Winter High Seas Expedition, the metadata associated with each science-discipline has to be provided. This will also help identify every data element, method, platform, and variable that Expedition Scientists plan to collect as well as identify the benchmarks of data mobility to aim for. 

Metadata associated with the data is supplied by the data provider and currently hosted in a catalogue (https://iys.hakai.org) on the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN). CKAN centralizes data access through a web portal, and the metadata hosted here is compliant with ISO 19115, making the data sets broadly discoverable across the federated system. Standardized metadata facilitates discovery and the navigation of search results. Our CKAN is a private and secure web portal. The CKAN will link to both the raw data files (i.e., raw sampling instrument output, processed data, sample processing protocols, calibration files, caveats for data interpretation, best practices), as well as the standardized (reformatted) data stored in a separate file on Google Drive and hosted on e.g. OBIS or ERDDAP. The metadata catalogue will be accessible to the scientists that provided the data. Metadata verification is currently done through engagement with the data provider, whereas the quality control for the standardized data will be done internally, with the data provider and with OBIS, to ensure that the standardized data meets the requirements set out by OBIS and will therefore be interoperable and connected with other data sets. Once approved for open access the CKAN Metadata Catalogue and the Google Drive folder will be made public. Agreement will be needed on the timeframe for data delivery, sharing and publication. 

In the metadata it is essential that roles are assigned to both people and organizations that are the responsible party (RP) or the point of contact (POC) for the resource (data provided). A definition of the ISO roles that can be assigned under both point of contact and responsible party is provided in Table 1 below. Having the correct metadata information is essential prior to hosting data in a trustworthy digital repository. In our current set up, only a single role can be assigned to a person or organization.

# 3. Proposed Communication Scheme 

A clear and well-defined communication scheme is essential to having an organized workflow throughout the IYS project. We propose that initially, communication regarding the data mobilization and communication process will be done between the Hakai Institute, the IYS Secretariat, the IYS Planning Team and the NPAFC Study Group. 

Standardization of the 2019 and the 2020 data collected will help identify key areas of attention, roadblocks, and help structure the data management plan and standardization workflow for the 2022 Pan-Pacific Winter High Seas Expedition. Through initial communications, we aim to address uncertainties and incorporate feedback regarding the data mobilization and standardization approach. After finalizing the standardization and communication approach, a presentation will be given to the Lead Scientists involved in the upcoming research cruise, with a case study that highlights the workflow for both biological and physical or biogeochemical data. A finalized document on the data mobilization and standardization process can then be distributed to the Principal Investigators (PIs) and 2022 Expedition Scientists within each Research Area (Figure 2).  

To demonstrate our standardization approach to identified 2022 Research Areas, we recommend using a subset of historic salmon diet data to format to international standards and host on OBIS. This will also highlight how the approach can be used to salvage and integrate historic data with the IYS project. Mobilizing and integrating a subset of historic salmon diet data can be used as a case study to determine the process for integrating disparate, heterogeneous datasets that remain relevant today. The salmon diet data can be particularly useful for this, as essentially it can be regarded as ‘occurrence’ data, i.e. which species occurred in the stomach content of salmon caught. 

The data standardization and mobilization process for physical or biogeochemical data can be demonstrated using e.g. a bottle file or CTD data collected during the 2019 or 2020 IYS High Seas Expedition. 

A critical first step in data mobilization and integration is ensuring that we have correct metadata that clearly outlines the data provenance and roles and responsibilities. Proper metadata is required to ensure data reproducibility, accountability and interoperability. In addition to communicating the data mobilization process to the research scientists through the IYS Planning Team, it is also recommended that a presentation is given to scientists in each IYS Research Area, as identified by the IYS Secretariat. This presentation is intended to elaborate on the data mobilization strategy chosen and the operationalization process and will allow research scientists the opportunity to ask questions. Furthermore, it will help set the stage for future communications between the Hakai Institute Data Management Team and scientists involved, should any questions regarding the data arise post-expedition. Active feedback and scientist participation and engagement will help construct and further develop the Data Mobilization and Communication plan for future expeditions. 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{IYS_Communication.png}

  \caption{Proposed communication flowchart. Initial communication on finalizing the data mobilization and standardization process will be done between the Hakai Institute, IYS Secretariat, Study Group, and the IYS Planning Team (solid lines). Once finalized, it will be communicated down the chain, giving IYS Lead Scientists, PIs and 2022 Expedition Scientists opportunity to give feedback and ask discipline-specific questions regarding the process to the Hakai Data Management Team (dashed line).}
\end{figure}

# 4. Recommendations moving forward

The Data Mobilization and Communication plan presented here is an evolving process, and collaboration and engagement with the IYS Secretariat, the ad hoc Study Group on High Seas Data Standardization and Mobilization, and the IYS Planning Team is critical to improve and finalize the standardization approach and salmon data digital infrastructure. To further improve the data management workflow, a recommendation is made for IYS salmon ocean ecology data to be hosted in a private repository on GitHub. This private repository would only be accessible to the responsible party (scientist, organization) and the Hakai Institute (data custodian), ensuring security of the data while simultaneously ensuring version control. There are numerous advantages to using GitHub as a platform to store or host the data, compared to Google Drive:

*	Data can be stored in a private repository, accessible only to the scientist and the data custodian. Once the repository is made public the data adheres to the FAIR data principles. 
*	This data repository provides version control for the data, making it very easy to see what version is the latest and what the changes are between versions. This ensures that the data wrangling is done to the latest version. 
*	The standardization R and Python scripts are also stored in the repository, allowing scientists to see what progress has been made on the standardization process if they so choose. 
*	GitHub offers a platform for communication, and questions related to the (meta)data can be asked directly to scientists if tagged. 

Once data is published by the scientists, the discipline-specific repository can be made public, thereby adhering to the FAIR data principles. Additionally, it is recommended that metadata be filled out well in advance of the 2022 Pan-Pacific Winter High Seas Expedition. A CIOOS Metadata Entry Tool is currently being developed, which will ensure that the metadata provided by the data provider is CIOOS-compliant. Once developed, this tool will also auto-populate the required fields in the CKAN IYS-OOS Catalogue. 

Finally, to increase participation and understanding of the data mobilization infrastructure and standardization approach, it is recommended that this process, once finalized, should be discussed and showcased to the scientists involved in each scientific discipline or Research Area. Using a case study and demonstrating the process and application of trusted repositories can increase collaboration efforts and engagement of scientists. It is a collaborative process, one where we aim to act as a facilitator that reduces the workload rather than adds to it. 

# 5. Conclusion

This Data Mobilization and Communication plan describes the data standardization approach of the salmon ocean ecology data collected during the IYS research cruises. Integrating and reformatting the data to an international standard increases the longevity and interoperability of the data and ensures that the data adhere to the FAIR data principles. We must ensure that the digital repositories used to host the data follow the TRUST principles for digital repositories. Furthermore, a brief overview is provided on the current, yet evolving standardization, mobilization and integration workflow. A communication scheme is proposed on how best to distill the data mobilization and standardization process through the various layers of the IYS project. Moving forward, it is recommended that IYS salmon ocean ecology data are stored in a private, secure repository on GitHub and a presentation provided to each IYS scientific discipline under GOOS to increase understanding, collaboration and engagement of scientists.

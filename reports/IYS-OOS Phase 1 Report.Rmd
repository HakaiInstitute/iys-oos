# Executive Summary

An agreement was signed between the Hakai Institute and the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission on February 3rd, 2020 for the Hakai Institute to scope and review the requirements of data management for high seas salmon ecology and oceanographic observations collected by the International Year of the Salmon collaborative project. Here, we recommended a number of actions and considerations for building and delivering digital infrastructure systems for integrating a keystone data ecosystem -- salmon ecology. Foremost we recommend timely, inclusive, and equitable data access. To that end we recommend adopting the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS) framework. The GOOS is a project of the United Nation's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and unifies networks of researchers around the world. Adopting the international standards and principles outlined broadly by UNESCO will ensure a multilateral approach inline with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to the standardization, integration, and equitable distribution of salmon ocean ecology data in British Columbia and beyond. 

Data collected by the 2019 High Seas Expedition is centrally accessible in an International Year of the Salmon Ocean Observation System (IYS-OOS) catalogue at https://iys.hakai.org. We provide a complete catalogue of the data sets produced by the IYS in 2019 with ISO 19115 compliant metadata records, making the knowledge that these data exist publicly findable and accessible - a fundamental first step in the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data principles.

We recommend four components of a Data Management and Communications Model:  1) Data catalogue records compliant with ISO 19115 (http://iys.hakai.org)-- COMPLETE; 2) Open-Access licensing and Open Data Access Protocols; 3) Controlled Vocabularies that define the variables, methods, units, platforms and measurement types used in salmon ocean ecology adhering to ‘Ocean Best Practices’ maintained by the Global Ocean Observation System; 4) A central, dedicated TRUSTed digital repository for hosting data and data-analysis tool-development code securely in perpetuity. 

# Introduction

The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) is implementing a five-year International Year of the Salmon (IYS) collaborative project through 2022 to set the conditions for the resilience of salmon and people in a rapidly changing world. Members nations of the NPAFC are collaborating on a multi-vessel Oceanographic Expedition planned for March 20201 covering from California North and West to Kamchatka, Russia and as far south as South Korea, including the Sea of Ohkotsk and parts of the Berring Sea. Trans-disciplinary researchers spanning Physical, Biogeochemical, and Biodiversity/Ecosystem domains from at least a dozen institutions and agencies will generate a complex set of data. Success will be measured by timely and equitable access to data and knowledge generated by the International Year of the Salmon. The NPAFC and the Hakai Institute with support from the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund and the Tula Foundation are conducting a review of current practices and new approaches to mobilizing salmon ocean ecology data, specifically for the data collected during the five-vessel survey planned for 2021.

# Methods

## Data Model

For every data element, collection method, platform, and variable produced by the IYS High Seas Expeditions in 2021, the following tasks need to be completed:  

* Determine whether the data element is already defined within GOOS framework. Such elements will be processed first because the requirements are well-defined. For data elements that do not naturally belong in IYS-OOS, determine whether there is a recognized and compatible repository where they belong and can be federated or linked to the IYS-OOS. Example alternative data repositories: Biodiversity of Life Online Database (BOLD), DataONE, Dryad, Federal Open Data, BC Gov. Data etc.)
* Publish. For all data elements, generate appropriate and valid metadata records to make the existence of the data public knowledge and insert the records into the metadata catalogue on the IYS Data Portal, so that they are findable and accessible by IYS users.
* Process. Work closely with the data provider to bring fully validated and standardized copies of data elements into the appropriate repositories.
* Communicate. Representatives from each scientific discipline involved with the IYS should connect through a working group that disseminates and advocates for best-practices.

## Management Model 

An executive-level steering committee will provide technical and strategic advice on the project while Hakai and NPAFC will retain administrative oversight of the project. Steering Committee participants will include:

* Eric Peterson/Brett Johnson – Hakai Institute
* Mark Saunders/Stephanie Taylor/Caroline Graham– IYS/NPAFC
* Dick Beamish and Brian Riddell – 2019 and 2020 Expeditions/Pacific Salmon Foundation
* Bruce Patten – DFO Pacific Biological Station and OBIS Canada Node Manager
* Erin Satterthwaite – GOOS BioEco Expert Panel Member
* Gabrielle Canonico - GOOS BioEco Panel Co-Chair & NOAA Federal
* Expedition Chief Scientists 

For the 2021 cruise to be successful, the establishment of a 'Data Standards Study Group' made up of relevant representation of stakeholders needs to be established as soon as possible to begin to prioritize every data element, method, platform, and variable they plan to collect. The NPAFC is a natural platform for this study group, so is the adoption of data standards put forward by the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS). GOOS is a program that is coordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). GOOS is governed by a multinational Steering Committee, three scientific domain Expert Panels, and many Observation Coordination Groups of people and organizations worldwide. GOOS is partnered with expert agencies in biological data—namely the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), Biodiversity of Life Online Database (BOLD) and the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON), Integrated Ocean Observation System (IOOS), and the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observation System (CIOOS). We recommend using established international standards connected to GOOS where available, and extending or developing standards where needed. The product of this strategic alignment and development we can call the International Year of the Salmon Ocean Observation System (IYS-OOS) for now.

## Science Model

Key research networks should be identified under the following non-arbitary science domains that reflect the GOOS Essential Ocean Variable (EOV) schema.



### Physical

### BioGeoChemical

### BioEco

### Ecosystem Modelling

# Timeline

## Phase 1

## Phase 2

Continue building Data Model. Determine which high-value 'sub projects' should be prioritized and actioned.

* A web-based IYS Data Portal. COMPLETE

* A metadata catalogue. COMPLETE

* A GOOS-compatible repository for physical and biogeochemical data acquired on the expeditions. IN PROGRESS

* Solutions for other data types: either as natural extensions of the GOOS model, as contemplated under the GOOS Bio Eco, or in other repositories, as mandated by our modelling decisions. IN PROGRESS

* Data Management Planning and Facilitation for 2021 Expeditions. IN PROGRESS


## Time Sensitive Challenges

Almost across the research domains, *documentation* of sensor or instrument calibration, collection protocols, sample processing protocols, data exchange protocols, sampling shipping and tracking protocols are inadequate. This includes equipment and platform descriptions, calibration files, instructions for how data were summarized or aggregated, and any caveats for data interpretation etc. This will help in ensuring the scientific integrity of the consolidated data sets. Dataset 'Quality' levels will eventually be assigned arbitarily based on completeness of metadata collection and integrity of provenance. Development of these guidelines among research domains is pressing.

Trawl catch data has not yet been received. My current understanding indicates that the dataset structure is under development, and that expedition scientists are working on this. Please understand that access to raw outputs and the detailed processing steps that occur to transform data are needed for complete data provenance. Keeping track of changes to raw data will help us ensure reproducibility, which is becoming commonly required in life sciences journals despite it being a high bar to aim for. Using a change log to manually document changes to the raw data ensures that reproducibility can be achieved when data cleaning is performed ad hoc such as removing outliers during quality control procedures, etc. Otherwise, we recommend moving to using automated version control, scripted data transformations and a metadata standard that canonically defines variables. This will help scientists collaborate on common data and analyses using modern cyber infrastructure that is already in place.

Translation of data is still needed for some data sets, including Juday Net zooplankton hauls. Translators with domain specific knowledge of the data need to be identified. There are also a number of questions we have related to specific data sets or metadata that we keep track of [here](https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/iys-oos/issues) for expedition scientists/data providers to view and respond to. We recommend the ad hoc development of a Data Standards Study Group, in advance of formal designation from overseeing bodies ASAP. We advocate for a core group comprised of representatives of each research domain (physical oceanography, salmon feeding ecology etc.) and representation from as many member nations and stakeholders as feasible.

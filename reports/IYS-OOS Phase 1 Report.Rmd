# Executive Summary

An agreement was signed between the Hakai Institute and the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission on February 3rd, 2020 for Hakai to scope and review the requirements of data management for high seas salmon ecology and oceanographic observations collected by the 'International Year of the Salmon' collaborative project. Here, we recommended a number of actions and considerations for building and delivering digital infrastructure systems to integrate a keystone data ecosystem--salmon ocean ecology. Foremost we recommend timely, inclusive, and equitable data access. To that end we recommend adopting the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS) framework. The GOOS is a project of the United Nation's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and unifies networks of researchers around the world. Adopting the international standards and principles outlined broadly by UNESCO will ensure an equitable and multilateral approach inline with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to the standardization, integration, and distribution of salmon ocean ecology data in British Columbia and beyond. 

Data collected by the 2019 research cruise is centrally accessible in an International Year of the Salmon Ocean Observation System (IYS-OOS) catalogue at https://iys.hakai.org. We provide a complete catalogue of the data sets produced by the IYS in 2019 with ISO 19115 compliant metadata records, making the knowledge that these data exist publicly discoverbale-a fundamental first step.

We recommend four components of a Data Management and Communications Model:  1) Data catalogue records compliant with ISO 19115 (http://iys.hakai.org)-- COMPLETE; 2) Open-Access licensing and Open Data Access Protocols; 3) Controlled Vocabularies that define the variables, methods, units, platforms and measurement types used in salmon ocean ecology adhering to ‘Ocean Best Practices’ maintained by the Global Ocean Observation System; 4) A dedicated TRUSTed digital repository for hosting data and data-analysis tool-development code securely in perpetuity. 

# Introduction

The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) is implementing a five-year International Year of the Salmon (IYS) collaborative project through 2022 to set the conditions for the resilience of salmon and people in a rapidly changing world. Members nations of the NPAFC are collaborating on a multi-vessel Oceanographic Expedition planned for 2021 covering from California North and West to Kamchatka, Russia and as south as South Korea, including the Sea of Okhotsk and parts of the Bering Sea. Trans-disciplinary research spanning Physical, BioGeoChemical, and Biodiversity/Ecosystem domains from at least a dozen institutions and agencies will generate a complex set of data. Success will be measured by timely and equitable access to data and knowledge generated by the International Year of the Salmon. The NPAFC and the Hakai Institute with support from the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund and the Tula Foundation are conducting a review of current practices and new approaches to mobilizing salmon ocean ecology data, specifically for the data collected during the multi-vessel survey planned for 2021.

# Methods

## Data Model

For every data element, collection method, platform, and variable produced by the IYS High Seas Expeditions in 2021, the following tasks need to be completed:  

* Determine whether the data element is already defined within GOOS framework. Such elements will be processed first because the requirements are well-defined. For data elements that do not naturally belong in IYS-OOS, determine whether there is a recognized and compatible repository where they belong and can be federated or linked to the IYS-OOS. Example alternative data repositories: Biodiversity of Life Online Database (BOLD), DataONE, Dryad, Federal Open Data, BC Gov. Data etc.)
* Publish. For all data elements, generate appropriate and valid metadata records to make the existence of the data public knowledge and insert the records into the metadata catalogue on the IYS Data Portal, so that they are discoverable by IYS users.
* Process. Work closely with data providers to bring fully validated and standardized copies of data elements into the appropriate repositories.
* Communicate. Representatives from each scientific discipline involved with the IYS should connect through a working group that disseminates and advocates for best-practices.

## Management Model 

An executive-level steering committee will provide technical and strategic advice on the project while Hakai and NPAFC will retain administrative oversight of the project. Steering Committee participants will include:

* Eric Peterson/Brett Johnson – Hakai Institute
* Mark Saunders/Stephanie Taylor/Caroline Graham– IYS/NPAFC
* Dick Beamish and Brian Riddell – 2019 and 2020 Expeditions/Pacific Salmon Foundation
* Bruce Patten – DFO Pacific Biological Station and OBIS Canada Node Manager
* Erin Satterthwaite – GOOS BioEco Expert Panel Member
* Gabrielle Canonico - GOOS BioEco Panel Co-Chair & NOAA Federal
* Expedition Chief Scientists 

For the 2021 cruise to be successful, the establishment of a data standards 'Study Team' made up of relevant representation of stakeholders needs to be established as soon as possible to begin to prioritize every data element, method, platform, and variable they plan to collect. The NPAFC is a natural platform for this study group, so is the adoption of data standards put forward by the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS). GOOS is a program that is coordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). GOOS is governed by a multinational Steering Committee, three scientific domain Expert Panels, and many Observation Coordination Groups of people and organizations worldwide. GOOS is partnered with expert agencies in biological data—namely the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), Biodiversity of Life Online Database (BOLD) and the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON), Intentional Ocean Observation System, and the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observation System. We recommend using established international standards promoted or interoperable with GOOS standards where available, and extending or developing standards where current best-practices are  not aligned. The product of this strategic alignment and development we can call the International Year of the Salmon Ocean Observation System (IYS-OOS) for now.

## Science Model

Key research networks should be identified under the following non-arbitrary science domains that reflect the GOOS Essential Ocean Variable schema.



### Physical

### BioGeoChemical

### BioEco

### Ecosystem Modelling

# Timeline

## Phase 1

Three themes determine the timeline:

1) Deepening Engagement and Impact; 2) System Integration and Delivery; and 3) Building for the Future.

## Phase 2

Continue building Data Model. Determine which high-value 'sub projects' should be prioritized and actioned.

* A web-based IYS Data Portal. COMPLETE

* A metadata catalogue. COMPLETE

* A GOOS-compatible repository for physical and biogeochemical data acquired on the expeditions. IN PROGRESS

* Solutions for other data types: either as natural extensions of the GOOS model, as contemplated under the GOOS Bio Eco, or in other repositories, as mandated by our modelling decisions. IN PROGRESS

* Data Management Planning and Facilitation for 2021 Expeditions. IN PROGRESS


## Time Sensitive Challenges

Almost across the board, *documentation* of sensor calibration, collection protocols, sample processing protocols, data exchange protocols, sampling shipping and tracking protocols are inadeqaut. This includes equipment and platform descriptions, calibration files, instructions for how data were summarized or aggregated, and any caveats for data interpretation etc... This will help in ensuring the scientific integrity of the consolidated data sets. Dataset 'Quality' levels will eventually be assigned based on completeness of metadata collection and integrity of provenance. Development of these guidelines among research domains is pressing.

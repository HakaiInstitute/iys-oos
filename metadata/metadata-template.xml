        This is a guide to adding metadata required to get a CIOOS-compatible dataset into ERDDAP
        This example is for an english language dataset. For french use language=fra, title_eng, summary_eng etc
    
        For entire list of supported attributes, see https://github.com/cioos-siooc/metadata-xml

    <!--
        This setting is required to get our custom CIOOS ISO XML served by ERDDAP 
        The dataset ID is found in the top line of the dataset's definition <dataset type=... datasetID=...> 
        The XML file doesn't need to exist on your computer.
        Example: <iso19115File>/xml/HakaiQuadraWeather5min_iso19115.xml</iso19115File>

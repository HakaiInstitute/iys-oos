## CHANGELOG

This document lists all of the data tidying and transformations applied to the raw file `Zoop Bongo Isotopes_IYS_Dry Weight_Mar31.xlsx`. 

Manual changes are described here, any scripts used to aid in data tidying can be found in `data_wrangle_bongo.Rmd`.

* For sampleID `Z383` the value in the `tissue` column has been changed to `whole` (as per pers. comm. with Brian H.)
* For sampleID `SS106` the value in the `lifeStage` column has been changed from `CV` to `adult` (as per comm. with Natalie Mahara). `CV` describes a life stage of copepodites, and SS106 is not a copepoda but E. pacifica.
* For sampleID `SS107` the value in the `lifeStage` column has been changed from `CV` to `NA`. This sample refers to Radiolarians, and the `CV` life stage is only applicable to copepodites.

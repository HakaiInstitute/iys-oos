In this changelog I want to keep track of any changes I have made to Caroline's original data manipulation and selection script (`npmsdd_data_manipulation_and_select_CG.Rmd`). 

Changes made:
- line 184: removed the following line of code: `dplyr::select(-prey_kingdom:-prey_species) %>%` - as these columns are useful for the data standardization for OBIS.

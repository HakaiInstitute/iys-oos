In this changelog I want to keep track of any changes I have made to Caroline's original data manipulation and selection script (`npmsdd_data_manipulation_and_select_CG.Rmd`). 

Changes made:
- line 184: removed the following line of code: `dplyr::select(-prey_kingdom:-prey_species) %>%` - as these columns are useful for the data standardization for OBIS. 
- As a result of previous change, in line #199 I change `51:ncol` to `58:ncol`. If I didn't do this, columns that included information on lat_max etc were also mutated and consequently no correct geographic representation could be provided for OBIS.
